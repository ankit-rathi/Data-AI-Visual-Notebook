### What Is a Decision?

A decision is not an action.
A decision is a **commitment to act before you know the outcome**.

If the outcome is already guaranteed, you’re not deciding—you’re executing. Real decisions only exist when the future is uncertain and you still have to choose.

From first principles, a decision has three parts.
First, there must be **more than one possible action**.
Second, each action can lead to **multiple possible outcomes**.
Third, you must choose **without knowing which outcome will occur**.

This is why decisions feel uncomfortable. They force you to act with incomplete information. Waiting for certainty is not a strategy—it’s just postponing the choice.

Think about hiring someone. You review resumes, conduct interviews, and check references. But you never *know* how the person will perform. At some point, you stop gathering information and decide. The offer letter is not the decision—it’s the result of one.

The same pattern appears in business and life. Launching a product, investing money, changing careers, or even choosing what to eat for health—none of these come with guaranteed outcomes. If they did, there would be no thinking involved.

This is where many people get confused. They judge decisions by results. A good outcome is praised as a good decision; a bad outcome is blamed as a bad one. But outcomes are noisy. A well-thought-out decision can still fail. A reckless decision can sometimes succeed by luck.

A good decision is defined by **process, not outcome**.
Did you clarify your goal?
Did you consider realistic options?
Did you use the best information available at the time?
Did you accept the uncertainty instead of pretending it didn’t exist?

Once you see decisions this way, responsibility becomes clearer. You control the choice and the reasoning behind it—not the result.

And this leads directly to the next idea.
If decisions are choices made without knowing results, then we must understand the space they operate in. That space is defined by **uncertainty and outcomes**.

**Hook (first 3–5 sec):**
Most people think a decision is an action.
It’s not.

**Core idea:**
A decision is choosing **before you know what will happen**.

If the outcome is guaranteed, you’re not deciding.
You’re just following instructions.

Real decisions only exist when the future is uncertain.

**Example:**
When you hire someone, invest money, or launch a product—you never know the result.
At some point, you stop collecting information and choose anyway.

That moment is the decision.

**Key distinction:**
Here’s the mistake people make.
They judge decisions by outcomes.

Good result? “Great decision.”
Bad result? “Terrible decision.”

But outcomes include luck.

A good decision is about the **process**, not the result.

Did you think clearly?
Did you use what you knew at the time?
Did you accept uncertainty instead of ignoring it?

**Close:**
You control the choice.
You don’t control the outcome.

And that’s why the next thing to understand is this:
**uncertainty and outcomes**.
