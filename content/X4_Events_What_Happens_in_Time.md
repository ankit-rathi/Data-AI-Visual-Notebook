### **Events — What Happens in Time**

Once we decide what to observe, the next question is **when something actually happens**. Reality is not static. It unfolds continuously, but our understanding of it advances through **events**—discrete moments where something changes. An event marks a boundary in time: before it, the world was one way; after it, the world is different.

Events are not the same as observations. Observation is about attention; events are about change. A customer placing an order, a payment failing, a machine stopping, a temperature crossing a threshold—these are all events. They exist whether or not anyone is watching. Observation decides whether we notice them, but events themselves belong to reality, not perception.

Why do events matter? Because decisions are shaped by change, not by stillness. Knowing that something exists is less useful than knowing **when it started, stopped, increased, failed, or reversed**. Events introduce time, sequence, and causality into our understanding. Without events, reality would feel frozen—informative but lifeless.

Events also give structure to uncertainty. A single observation tells us what is true at a moment. A sequence of events tells us how reality behaves over time. In business, growth is not a number—it is a pattern of events. Risk is not a concept—it is revealed through failures, delays, and near misses occurring across time.

However, events are still raw. They are messy, numerous, and uneven. Some are rare but important, others frequent but trivial. Some are clearly defined, others ambiguous. On their own, events cannot be reasoned about at scale. They need to be captured, labeled, and stored in a way that allows comparison and analysis.

This is the transition point. Events are where reality touches systems. The moment we decide to record an event, we freeze a slice of time and turn change into something persistent. That act—capturing events so they can be remembered, processed, and analyzed—is how we move from lived reality into structured representation. That is the step where **events become data**.

* Reality changes
  *(world not static)*
* Time matters
  *(before vs after)*
* Change creates meaning
  *(nothing happens, nothing to learn)*

### 2. What an Event Is

**Icon:** Timestamp marker

* Moment of change
  *(something becomes different)*
* Anchored in time
  *(has a “when”)*
* Independent of observers
  *(happens even if unseen)*

### 3. Events vs Observation

**Icon:** Eye + clock

* Observation selects
  *(what we notice)*
* Events occur
  *(what actually happens)*
* Not the same thing
  *(attention ≠ reality)*

### 4. Why Events Matter

**Icon:** Domino chain

* Enable sequence
  *(order of happenings)*

## YOUTUBE SHORTS — 60-SECOND TRANSCRIPT

Once we choose what to observe, the next question is when something happens.

Reality moves through events—
moments where something changes.
Before the event, the world is one way.
After it, the world is different.

An event isn’t about attention.
It exists whether anyone is watching or not.
A customer places an order.
A system fails.
A price changes.

Events matter because decisions respond to change, not stillness.
One observation tells you what’s true right now.
A sequence of events tells you how reality behaves over time.

That’s where patterns come from.
Growth, risk, and failure only make sense when you see events unfold across time.

But events on their own are messy.
There are too many of them, and not all are equally important.

To think clearly, we need to capture events, freeze them, and store them.
That’s the moment where reality starts turning into something we can analyze.

And that’s the next step—
**from events to data**.
