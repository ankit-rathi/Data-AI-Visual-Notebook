## *Decision*

A decision exists only because the future is uncertain. If we already knew what would happen, there would be no need to decide—only to act. Decisions are not about certainty; they are about **commitment in the presence of uncertainty**.

At its simplest, a decision has three ingredients. First, there must be **choices**—different actions we could take. Second, there must be **outcomes**—different ways the future might unfold after we act. Third, there must be **uncertainty**, meaning we do not know in advance which outcome will occur. Remove any one of these, and the decision disappears. With no uncertainty, decisions become rules. With no choice, they become inevitability.

A common misunderstanding is to judge decisions by how they turn out. When results are bad, we label the decision itself as bad. But outcomes are shaped not only by judgment, but also by chance. A well-reasoned decision can lead to an unfavorable outcome, while a poorly reasoned one can occasionally succeed. If we judge decisions only by results, we train ourselves to fear uncertainty instead of learning how to reason within it.

A better way to evaluate a decision is to ask whether it was **reasonable given the information available at the time**. A good decision uses the best signals it can access, acknowledges what is unknown, and accepts trade-offs consciously. It does not pretend to predict the future; it prepares for multiple plausible futures.

This is where data enters the picture. Data does not remove uncertainty. Its role is to **reduce surprise**, clarify trade-offs, and support judgment. When data is treated as a source of certainty, it replaces thinking with false confidence. When used properly, it sharpens decision-making without denying uncertainty.

In everyday life and in business, decisions are everywhere—pricing a product, choosing a strategy, hiring a person, or investing time and resources. None of these choices come with guarantees. They all require moving forward without complete information.

A decision, then, is an act of responsibility. It is the moment we say: *given what I know, what I don’t know, and the risks I accept, this is the path I choose*.
To understand why decisions are difficult—and why outcomes so often surprise us—we must now turn to **uncertainty and outcomes**.

What is a decision?

A decision only exists because the future is uncertain.
If you already knew what would happen, you wouldn’t be deciding—you’d just be executing.

Every decision has three parts.
There are choices you can make, outcomes that might follow, and uncertainty connecting the two.

Where people often go wrong is judging decisions by outcomes.
But outcomes include luck. A good decision can still lead to a bad result, and a bad decision can sometimes work out.

So a good decision isn’t about being right in hindsight.
It’s about being reasonable with the information you had at the time.

Data helps here, but it doesn’t remove uncertainty.
It reduces surprise and sharpens judgment, but the future always remains open.

A decision is a moment of responsibility.
You look at what you know, what you don’t know, and you choose anyway.

And to understand why outcomes surprise us so often, the next thing we need to talk about is **uncertainty and outcomes**.
