## Incentive Alignment in Data Organizations

In the previous topic, we examined the strategic choice between building and buying capabilities. But choosing a path is only the beginning. Execution depends on people.

And people respond to incentives.

Data organizations often struggle not because of weak models or poor infrastructure, but because incentives are misaligned. Teams optimize for what they are measured on. If those measurements conflict with business outcomes, value erodes.

Consider common patterns. Data teams are rewarded for shipping models, not for improving decisions. Engineering teams are rewarded for system uptime, not for business impact. Business units are rewarded for quarterly targets, not for long-term data quality.

Each group performs rationally according to its metrics. Yet the system as a whole drifts.

Incentive alignment means ensuring that local optimization supports global objectives.

If ROI is the strategic lens, then incentives must reinforce decision improvement, not activity volume. Model deployment should be tied to measurable outcome shifts. Data quality should be linked to downstream decision reliability. Maintenance work should be recognized as value protection, not overhead.

Misalignment creates predictable distortions. Teams overproduce dashboards because usage is easy to measure. Models are deployed without accountability because experimentation is rewarded. Technical debt accumulates because short-term delivery is incentivized.

Alignment does not mean identical metrics for everyone. It means coherent metrics.

When incentives are aligned, friction decreases. Teams coordinate more naturally because success is shared. Tradeoffs become explicit rather than political.

Incentive design is therefore a structural decision, not a cultural slogan. It determines what behaviors compound over time.

If build versus buy is about strategic positioning, incentive alignment is about execution integrity.

And once incentives are aligned, another tension emerges:

Should decisions be made faster, or made better?

That takes us to decision velocity versus decision quality.

# YOUTUBE SHORT (~60 seconds, medium-length conversational sentences)

After deciding whether to build or buy, the next challenge is execution.
And execution depends on incentives.

Teams optimize for what they are measured on.
If those measurements conflict with business outcomes, value quietly erodes.

A data team rewarded for shipping models will ship models.
An engineering team rewarded for uptime will focus on stability.
A business team rewarded for quarterly targets will prioritize short-term results.

Each group behaves rationally.
But the system as a whole can drift away from real value.

Incentive alignment means ensuring that local metrics support global objectives.
Deployment should connect to measurable decision improvement.
Data quality should connect to decision reliability.

When incentives align, coordination becomes easier and tradeoffs become clearer.

And once incentives are aligned, a new tension appears.
Should we make decisions faster, or should we make them better?

That is the balance between decision velocity and decision quality.
