## From Events to Data

In the previous topic, we examined events as moments that change reality. Events happen in time whether we observe them or not. They are raw shifts in the world.

But raw events are not yet usable.

If something changes and no record exists, it disappears from analysis. To reason about the past, we must capture it. This transition — from happening to recording — is where data begins.

Data is not reality itself. It is a structured trace of reality.

When we convert events into data, we make choices. We decide what counts as an event. We define when it starts and ends. We assign identifiers. We attach timestamps. Every one of these decisions shapes what will later be visible.

Recording creates durability. What was fleeting becomes persistent. A moment becomes a row in a table. A change becomes a stored value. Now it can be counted, compared, aggregated, and modeled.

But structure comes at a cost.

Reality is continuous and messy. Data is discrete and organized. To store an event, we simplify it. We reduce context. We compress nuance into fields. What does not fit the schema is excluded.

This means that data is already filtered reality. It reflects not only what happened, but also how we chose to represent what happened.

If events are the raw material of change, data is the engineered representation of that change.

Understanding this boundary matters. When we analyze data, we are never working directly with reality. We are working with a structured interpretation of it.

Once events become data, patterns begin to emerge. Variation becomes visible. Movement becomes measurable.

But that raises a new challenge:

Which patterns reflect something real, and which are just fluctuation?

That is where signal versus noise begins.

# YOUTUBE SHORT (~60 seconds, medium-length conversational sentences)

In the last topic, we discussed events as moments that change reality. They happen in time whether we observe them or not.

But if an event is not recorded, it disappears from analysis.
To reason about the past, we have to capture what happened.

That is where data begins.

Data is not reality itself. It is a structured trace of reality. When we turn events into data, we make decisions about what counts, how it is defined, and how it is stored.

We add timestamps, identifiers, and fields so the moment becomes durable and comparable.

But structure comes with trade-offs. Reality is messy and continuous, while data is organized and discrete. In simplifying events into records, we compress context and lose nuance.

So whenever we analyze data, we are working with a designed representation of what happened, not the full event itself.

And once events become data, patterns begin to appear.

The next question is simple but critical:
Which patterns are meaningful, and which are just fluctuation?

That is where signal versus noise begins.
