# **Data & AI Visual Notebook – Master Framework v3 (Feb 2026)**

*Status: Final. Active. Governing.*

This version includes:

* Icon alignment rule (Visual Notes)
* Medium-length sentence rule (YouTube Shorts)
* All prior structural constraints
* All prior versions superseded

# CORE IDENTITY

**Theme:** Judgment Under Uncertainty

This notebook is not about tools.
It is about disciplined thinking when reality is imperfect.

Data is incomplete.
Measurement is flawed.
Models are abstractions.

The objective is structured judgment — not output generation.

---

# TEACHING PHILOSOPHY

1. **Cognition Before Computation**
   Thinking precedes tools.

2. **Why Before How**
   Concept before method.

3. **Single Idea Per Topic**
   No abstraction stacking.

4. **Memory-First Design**
   Structure must aid recall.

5. **Calm Authority Tone**
   No hype. No intellectual noise.

6. **Compression Without Density Creep**
   Dense thinking. Light language.

---

# STRUCTURAL ARCHITECTURE (MANDATORY)

Every topic must contain exactly three components:

1. RIGHT PAGE — Article
2. LEFT PAGE — Visual Note
3. YouTube Short — Reinforcement

All three must align conceptually.
No idea expansion across formats.

---

# 1️⃣ RIGHT PAGE — ARTICLE (350–390 words)

### Standards

* One central idea only
* Clean bridge from previous topic
* Natural setup for next topic
* Why-before-how progression
* No scope creep
* No repetition
* No filler

### Structure Pattern

* Opening tension or contrast
* Concept clarification
* Practical implication
* Bridge forward

Failure in conceptual containment = rewrite.

---

# 2️⃣ LEFT PAGE — VISUAL NOTE

(Karina Viola Stolz style discipline)

### Structural Rules

* Exactly 7–8 sections
* Each section must include:

  * Relevant icon
  * Section header
  * 2–4 short bullets
  * Cue phrases in parentheses

---

## 🔒 Icon Rule (Permanent)

Each section must include a **relevant, concept-aligned icon**.

Icon must:

* Represent the core section idea
* Be intuitive and drawable
* Not be decorative
* Pass the memory-anchor test

If icon requires explanation → reject.
If icon is symbolic but not structural → reject.
If repeated without reason → revise.

---

## Bullet & Cue Grammar (Permanent)

Bullet:

* Minimal conceptual handle
* Not explanatory
* Not a sentence
* Stable idea block

Cue (in parentheses):

* Short clarifying phrase
* Explains the bullet
* Adds no new idea
* Slight expansion only

If cue introduces a new dimension → fail.
If bullet reads like explanation → compress.

---

## Visual Flow Requirement

* Sections must progress logically
* Feels like staircase, not list
* Fully drawable in under 7 minutes
* No density creep

---

# 3️⃣ YOUTUBE SHORT (~60 seconds)

Purpose: Reinforcement only.
No expansion beyond article.

---

## 🔒 Sentence-Length Rule (Permanent)

Sentences must be:

* Medium length
* Natural conversational rhythm
* Simple spoken English
* Not choppy
* Not overly dramatic
* Not textbook
* Not compressed fragments

Over-fragmentation = structural violation.
Over-complexity = structural violation.

---

# CROSS-FORMAT INTEGRITY

All three formats must:

* Express the same single idea
* Maintain tone consistency
* Preserve conceptual boundaries
* Avoid scope expansion
* Reinforce memory structure

If YouTube introduces a new idea → rewrite.
If Visual adds depth beyond article → rewrite.

---

# TOPIC SEQUENCING DISCIPLINE

Each topic must:

* Connect explicitly to previous
* Introduce only one new constraint
* Prepare mental ground for next
* Avoid abstraction jumps

Progression must feel cumulative and controlled.

---

# LANGUAGE GUARDRAILS

* No buzzwords without definition
* No dramatic metaphors
* No clever phrasing for performance
* No academic inflation
* No vague generalities

Clarity > cleverness
Precision > performance

---

# PRE-PUBLISH CHECKLIST (MANDATORY)

Before finalizing any topic:

* ✔ Single idea preserved
* ✔ Why-before-how respected
* ✔ 350–390 word article
* ✔ 7–8 visual sections
* ✔ Relevant icon per section
* ✔ Bullets minimal
* ✔ Cues clarify only
* ✔ Logical staircase progression
* ✔ Medium-length YouTube sentences
* ✔ No density creep
* ✔ Clean bridge forward

If any item fails → revise before publishing.
