## 📐 GLOBAL RULES (Apply to ALL topics)

1. **First-principles thinking**

   * Explain *why the concept exists* before *what it is*
   * Build intuition before terminology

2. **No repetition rule**

   * Assume **Previous Topic is fully understood**
   * Do NOT restate or re-explain it
   * Only extend the mental model forward

3. **Cross-format cohesion**

   * Article, Visual Note, and YouTube Shorts must:

     * Express the same core ideas
     * Reinforce each other from different angles
     * Never introduce new concepts independently

4. **Learning-first**

   * Focus on judgment, reasoning, and decision quality
   * Tools, math, or systems only serve understanding

## 🧠 OUTPUT STRUCTURE (ALWAYS IN THIS ORDER)

---

## RIGHT PAGE — ARTICLE

**Style:** Cassie Kozyrkov
**Length:** ~370 words (comfortably fits one book page)
**Tone:** Clear, analytical, calm, insight-driven

**Must include:**

* First-principles motivation
* Real-life + business intuition
* Clear conceptual boundaries
* Final paragraph that *naturally hands off* to **Next Topic**

---

## LEFT PAGE — VISUAL NOTE

**Style:** Karina Viola Stolz
**Format:** Single page, hand-drawable, uncluttered

### TOP

**Topic Title**
**Punchy Tagline**

* One short phrase
* Intuitive, memorable
* *Not a sentence*

> Example:
> **Uncertainty and Outcomes**
> *Knowing less than we’d like*

---

### BODY (6–8 sections max)

For **each section**:

1. **Section Heading**
2. **ONE big icon suggestion** (central metaphor)
3. **2–4 short bullets**

   * Simple language
   * Memory-first
   * **Phrases, not sentences**
4. **Optional bracketed elaboration for EACH bullet**

   * Example, intuition, analogy, or clarification
   * Clearly skippable if space is limited
   * No explicit “Cue” label — brackets imply optional depth

> Default view stays clean
> Brackets are for depth, not clutter

---

### END

**Explicit bridge to Next Topic**

* Why the next idea is necessary
* What breaks without it

---

## 🎥 YOUTUBE SHORTS — 60-SECOND TRANSCRIPT

**Style:** Spoken, thoughtful, conversational
**Sentence length:** **Short to medium**

* Not punchy fragments
* Not long lectures

**Tone:**

* Calm
* Reflective
* Intuitive
* Sounds like *you explaining something you’ve thought about*

**Rules:**

* No slogans
* No hype
* No jargon without intuition
* End by clearly teeing up the **Next Topic**

---

## 🔁 CONSISTENCY CHECK (INTERNAL)

Before finalizing:

* Same idea appears across:

  * Article → depth
  * Visual Note → memory
  * Shorts → intuition
* No repetition of Previous Topic
* No conceptual drift
* Clean handoff to Next Topic

---

## ✅ Cross-check vs previous version (nothing lost)

- ✔ Cassie-style article (~370 words) — retained
- ✔ Karina-style visual notes — refined, not diluted
- ✔ Optional cues per bullet — clarified, cleaner
- ✔ Big icon per section — retained
- ✔ YouTube Shorts speaking preference — **improved**
- ✔ Cross-format cohesion rule — retained
- ✔ No-repetition constraint — retained
- ✔ Prompt format — retained

**Net effect:**
The template is now **more precise, more drawable, more “you”** — without losing any structural strength.
