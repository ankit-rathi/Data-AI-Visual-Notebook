# 🔒 LOCKED: Data & AI Visual Notebook — Content Template

This template defines **structure, style, cohesion rules, and output format** for every topic in the book.

You only need to recall it using the prompt at the end.

---

## 📐 Fixed Output Structure (Order Is Mandatory)

Every topic response must appear in **this exact order**:

### 1️⃣ RIGHT PAGE — Article

* **Length:** ~370 words (book-ready, one right-hand page)
* **Style:** Cassie Kozyrkov
* **Tone:** Calm, clear, first-principles, decision-focused
* **Purpose:**

  * Explain *why* the concept exists
  * Build intuition from reality → abstraction
  * Use real-life and business examples
* **Rules:**

  * Plain English, no jargon unless explained
  * No equations, no tools-first framing
  * Ends with **one clear bridge line to the next topic**

➡️ This is the **thinking layer**

---

### 2️⃣ LEFT PAGE — Visual Note

* **Style:** Karina Viola Stolz
* **Format:** Single page, hand-drawable
* **Design principles:**

  * High whitespace
  * Sketch-friendly
  * Memory-first, not explanation-first

#### For EACH section in the visual note:

* **One big, clear icon** representing the section (simple metaphor)
* **Multiple bullet points**, and for EACH bullet:

  * **Core bullet text** (short, essential, memory hook)
  * **Optional cue / extension** *(example, intuition, analogy)*

    * Clearly skippable
    * Space-dependent
    * Always provided, never mandatory

#### Visual note rules:

* Default view must remain **clean and uncluttered**
* Optional cues exist only to deepen understanding if space allows
* Final section must explicitly show:
  **“Leads to → Next Topic”**

➡️ This is the **memory layer**

---

### 3️⃣ YOUTUBE SHORTS — 60-Second Transcript

* **Style:** Spoken, simple, intuitive
* **Language:** Conversational, non-technical
* **Rules:**

  * Same ideas as the article — **no new concepts**
  * Same framing as visual note — **same mental model**
  * Strong hook in first 3–5 seconds
  * One clear takeaway or reflective question at the end

➡️ This is the **attention layer**

---

## 🔁 Cross-Format Cohesion Rules (Strict)

All three formats must:

* Convey the **same core truth**
* Use **consistent language and metaphors**
* Reinforce each other, not repeat verbatim
* Follow a one-way compression flow:

**Article → Visual Note → YouTube Short**

🚫 Shorts or visuals must NEVER introduce ideas not present in the article.

---

## 🧠 Teaching Philosophy (Implicit but Enforced)

* First principles before terminology
* Reality → abstraction → decision impact
* Explanation over description
* Judgment over automation
* Wisdom over optimization
