# 📘 Data & AI: A Visual Notebook

## **Final Content Template (Review Version)**

This template defines **how every topic in the book is explained, visualized, and spoken**, ensuring clarity, coherence, and learning depth.

---

## 🧱 Fixed Output Structure (Order Is Mandatory)

Every topic response must follow this **exact sequence**:

---

## 1️⃣ RIGHT PAGE — Article

**Length:** ~370 words (comfortably fits one right-hand book page)
**Style:** Cassie Kozyrkov
**Tone:** Calm, clear, first-principles, decision-focused

### Purpose

* Explain *why* the concept exists
* Start from reality, not terminology
* Build intuition before abstraction
* Use real-life and business examples
* Emphasize judgment over certainty

### Rules

* Plain English, no jargon unless explained
* No equations, no tool-first framing
* No hype, no motivational language
* End with **one clear bridging sentence** connecting to the next topic

➡️ This is the **thinking layer**

---

## 2️⃣ LEFT PAGE — Visual Note

**Style:** Karina Viola Stolz
**Format:** Single-page, hand-drawable visual note

### Design Principles

* High whitespace
* Sketch-friendly
* Memory-first, not explanation-first
* Clean by default, expandable if space allows

### Section Rules

For **each section** in the visual note:

* Exactly **one large, clear icon**

  * Simple metaphor
  * Easy to hand-draw
  * Represents the core idea of the section

### Bullet Rules

For **each bullet point**:

* **Core bullet text**

  * Very short
  * Acts as a memory hook
* **Optional cue / extension**

  * Example, intuition, or analogy
  * Clearly skippable
  * Space-dependent
  * Always provided, never mandatory

### Additional Rules

* No full sentences required
* Visual note should still work using only core bullets + icons
* Final section must explicitly show:
  **“Leads to → Next Topic”**

➡️ This is the **memory layer**

## 3️⃣ YOUTUBE SHORTS — 60-Second Transcript

**Style:** Spoken, intuitive, thoughtful

### Voice & Delivery

* Medium-length sentences
* Calm, reflective, conversational
* Sounds like someone explaining thoughtfully, not performing
* Avoids:

  * Slogans
  * One-liners
  * Hype language

### Content Rules

* Same ideas as the article — **no new concepts**
* Same framing and metaphors as the visual note
* Clear opening that frames the question
* One clear takeaway or reflective closing thought
* ~60 seconds when spoken naturally

➡️ This is the **attention layer**

---

## 🔁 Cross-Format Cohesion Rules (Strict)

All three formats must:

* Convey the **same core truth**
* Use **consistent language and metaphors**
* Reinforce each other without repetition
* Follow a one-way compression flow:

**Article → Visual Note → YouTube Shorts**

🚫 Visual notes and Shorts must never introduce ideas not present in the article.

---

## 🧠 Teaching Philosophy (Implicit but Enforced)

* First principles before terminology
* Reality → abstraction → decision impact
* Explanation over description
* Judgment over automation
* Wisdom over optimization
