Stored.

Below is the **only active and locked version** of your framework for reference.

# **Data & AI Visual Notebook – Master Framework v3 (First-Principles Constitution, Refined)**

**Status: Active. Governing. Locked.**

All prior versions superseded.

---

# I. Foundational Axiom

The purpose of this notebook is to train disciplined judgment under uncertainty.

Anything that does not strengthen structured reasoning is removed.

---

# II. Core Cognitive Law

Thinking precedes tools.

Therefore:

* Definitions before techniques
* Assumptions before conclusions
* Tradeoffs before optimization
* Decision quality before outcome quality

Mechanics without reasoning is structural failure.

---

# III. Single-Idea Law

Each topic contains exactly one irreducible idea.

If two independent ideas appear → split.
If abstraction layers stack → simplify.
If scope expands → defer to next topic.

Containment is mandatory.

---

# IV. Structural Triad

Each idea must exist in three synchronized forms:

1. **Article** — reasoning clarity
2. **Visual Note** — memory structure
3. **YouTube Short** — spoken reinforcement

All three must express the same idea.
No expansion across formats.

---

# V. Article Principle (Reasoning Integrity)

The article must:

* Use first-principles reasoning
* Follow Cassie Kozyrkov–style clarity and discipline
* Begin from definitional grounding
* Surface assumptions explicitly
* Distinguish decision quality from outcome quality
* Frame uncertainty and tradeoffs structurally
* Maintain calm, rational authority
* Avoid hype, metaphorical drama, or jargon

Length constraint: **~350–390 words (target ≈370).**

Structure must:

1. Introduce tension or misconception
2. Clarify concept from first principles
3. Show practical implication under uncertainty
4. Bridge naturally to next constraint

If it persuades instead of clarifies → rewrite.
If it performs instead of reasons → rewrite.

---

# VI. Visual Principle (Memory Architecture)

The visual note must:

* Follow Karina Viola Stolz–style structural minimalism
* Contain exactly **7–8 sections**
* Progress logically (staircase, not list)
* Be drawable in under 7 minutes
* Externalize structure, not explanation

Each section must contain:

* **One explicit, relevant, concept-aligned icon suggestion**
* One section header
* **2–4 minimal conceptual bullets**
* **Cue phrase with every bullet (in brackets)** — clarifying only, no new idea

Icon rules:

* One icon per section
* Icon must represent structural meaning
* Icon must be intuitive and drawable
* No decorative symbolism

Bullets = conceptual handles only.
Cues = slight clarification only.
No explanatory sentences inside visual.

If density increases → simplify.
If explanation enters visual → compress.

---

# VII. Crux Law

Every topic must reduce to **one sentence**.

The crux must:

* Capture the entire idea
* Connect previous and next topic
* Function as slide headline
* Function as narration opener

If it cannot compress into one sentence, the idea is unclear.

---

# VIII. YouTube Reinforcement Law

The short must:

* Use medium-length natural spoken sentences
* Sound conversational, not academic
* Introduce no new idea
* Reinforce the same conceptual boundary

Over-fragmentation or over-complexity = violation.

---

# IX. Language Guardrail

Clarity over cleverness.
Precision over performance.

No buzzwords without definition.
No dramatic metaphors.
No academic inflation.
No intellectual noise.

---

# X. Drift Control Mechanism

Activation phrase:

> **Apply Master Framework v3 strictly.**

Upon activation:

* Single-idea validation
* Cassie-style first-principles validation
* Karina-style visual validation
* Structural triad validation
* Density validation
* Cross-format integrity validation

If any fails → rewrite before delivery.

---

# XI. Integrity Test

Before publishing any topic, confirm:

1. Exactly one idea?
2. First-principles clarity with Cassie discipline?
3. Visual follows Karina structure with one icon per section and cue per bullet?
4. Crux fully contains the idea?
5. All three formats aligned?
6. No density creep?

If any answer is no → revise.

---

# Governing Standard

This is not a checklist.
It is a compression discipline.

If output feels inflated, layered, clever, or heavy — it violates the constitution.
