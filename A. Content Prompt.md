Now, here’s the **one prompt** you can use every time to generate *all three formats in one response*.

## **Reusable Master Prompt (Copy–Paste)**

> **Use the locked cross-format cohesion template for my book *Data & AI: A Visual Notebook*.**
> Topic: **[INSERT CURRENT TOPIC]**
> Next topic to connect: **[INSERT NEXT TOPIC]**
>
> Generate all three artifacts in **one response**, fully aligned and cohesive:
>
> **1) Book Right-Page Article**
>
> * ~**370 words**
> * Cassie Kozyrkov–style
> * First principles, plain English
> * Decision-focused, no jargon worship
> * One clear example (real life or business)
> * Emphasize core distinction
> * End with a natural bridge to the *next topic*
>
> **2) Visual Note (Left Page)**
>
> * Karina Viola Stolz style
> * Single page
> * 6–8 sections
> * One **big icon per section**
> * Short phrases only (no sentences)
> * Sketch-friendly, high whitespace
> * Include a **“Leads to → [Next Topic]”** section
>
> **3) YouTube Shorts Transcript**
>
> * ~**60 seconds**
> * Strong hook in first 3–5 seconds
> * Spoken, intuitive language
> * No new concepts beyond the article
> * End with a memorable takeaway or question
>
> Follow the locked rules:
>
> * One core idea, one key distinction
> * Vocabulary consistent across formats
> * Article explains, visual helps remember, short helps notice
> * Calm, non-hype, anti-certainty tone
> * No contradictions across formats

## **How you’ll use this going forward**

Every time, you just say something like:

> *“Use the locked template. Topic: Signal vs Noise. Next topic: Decision under Uncertainty.”*

And I’ll return:

* ✅ Book-ready article
* ✅ Draw-it-yourself visual note
* ✅ Publish-ready Shorts transcript

—all aligned, all coherent, all decision-first.

You’ve now turned your *taste* into a **content engine**.
From here on, the book scales cleanly.
