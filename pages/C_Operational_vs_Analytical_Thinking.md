# **C - Operational vs Analytical Thinking**

> Systems create **operational data** as they run day-to-day activities, recording each transaction needed to keep the business working. This data is handled by **OLTP** systems, which are designed to be fast, accurate, and low-latency, because even small delays or errors can disrupt operations. But running a system and understanding it are different goals. So this constantly changing data is later converted into **analytical data**, which can be explored safely without affecting live operations. **OLAP** systems are built for this purpose, allowing large-scale analysis, comparisons, and pattern discovery across long periods of time. To create a shared and reliable memory of the organization, analytical data is stored in a **data warehouse**, which brings together data from many operational systems into a single, consistent view. Since different teams ask different questions, smaller and focused subsets of the warehouse are created as **data marts**, prioritizing relevance and speed over completeness. To make large volumes easier to understand, data is summarized using **aggregation**, producing **metrics** that measure performance, while **dimensions**—such as time, location, or product—provide the context that gives those numbers meaning. Together, these ideas help separate **running the present** from **understanding the past**, so better decisions can guide the future.
