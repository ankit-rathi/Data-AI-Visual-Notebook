> Reality is continuously unfolding, but we can never grasp it in full, so we break it into **events**—specific moments where something changes. Only some events are **observed**, because observation is selective and limited by what we choose and are able to notice. Once observed, we impose structure through **measurement**, converting messy experiences into numbers, which then get stored as **data**. However, data is a mixture of meaning and randomness: much of it is **noise**, while only a small part forms a **signal**—a pattern that persists across time and repetitions. Even signals do not eliminate **uncertainty**, because the future is not a continuation of the past but a range of possibilities. A **decision** is therefore not an act of certainty but an act of judgment: choosing a path using imperfect signals extracted from noisy data, under unavoidable uncertainty.
