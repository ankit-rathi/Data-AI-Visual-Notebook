> Reality is always changing, but we can never see or understand it completely. To make sense of it, we look at **events**—specific moments when something happens. We only notice some events, because our attention is limited. When we do **observe** an event, we try to **measure** it, turning messy experiences into numbers we can store as **data**. But not all data is useful: much of it is **noise**, and only a small part is **signal**—patterns that repeat over time. Even when we find a signal, the future is still uncertain. That’s why making a **decision** is never perfectly certain; it is a judgment made using the imperfect signals we can find. In this section, we will explore each of these ideas step by step, and see how they connect from **reality to data to decision-making**.
