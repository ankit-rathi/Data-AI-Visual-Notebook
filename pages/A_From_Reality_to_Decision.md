> Reality is always changing, but we can never see or understand it completely. To make sense of it, we look at **events**—specific moments when something happens. We only notice some events, because our attention is limited. When we do **observe** an event, we try to **measure** it, turning messy experiences into numbers we can store as **data**. But not all data is useful: much of it is **noise**, and only a small part is **signal**—patterns that repeat over time. Even when we find a signal, the future is still uncertain. That’s why making a **decision** is never perfectly certain; it is a judgment made using the imperfect signals we can find. In this section, we will explore each of these ideas step by step, and see how they connect from **reality to data to decision-making**.

**Reality is continuously unfolding, independent of our awareness or understanding.** It is too vast, too detailed, and too fast-moving for any mind or system to fully capture. To make sense of it, we naturally break reality into **events**—specific moments where something changes in a way that matters. An order is placed, a payment fails, a user clicks a button, a machine overheats. Events exist because change is the only way reality becomes noticeable. Without change, there is nothing to record, remember, or act upon.

At a simple level, an **event** is just a meaningful change at a moment in time. In everyday life, a door opening is an event, a train arriving is an event, and a heartbeat is an event. In business, a customer signup, a product return, or a server crash are all events. Events help us compress the continuous flow of reality into discrete pieces that can be noticed, shared, and remembered. However, not every change becomes an event—only the ones we decide are important. Reality produces infinite change, but events exist only where meaning is assigned.

This reveals an important limit: **events do not exist on their own—they require attention**. If no one notices a change, it never becomes an event in any practical sense. To turn raw change into something usable, reality must first be **observed**, which determines *what* changes are seen and which are ignored. This brings us to the next step in the chain: **observation**.

**Mental model:**
*Reality is continuous, but meaning begins only when change is noticed as an event—observation decides which changes matter.*

---

**Reality produces countless events, but not all of them become meaningful.** This is because attention is limited—no person or system can notice everything. **Observation** exists to solve this constraint. It is the act of choosing *what* events to notice and *what* to ignore. Observation is not passive; it is selective by design. What we observe is shaped by our goals, tools, and biases. Two people can exist in the same reality, yet observe entirely different worlds.

At a simple level, **observation** means detecting that an event has occurred. In everyday life, hearing a horn is an observation, seeing a notification is an observation, and noticing a sudden headache is an observation. In business, observing a spike in website traffic, a delayed shipment, or a failed transaction are all observations. Observation turns raw events into signals that enter our awareness, but at this stage, they are still vague and subjective. We know *something* happened, but not precisely *how much*, *how often*, or *how severe* it was.

This is the natural limit of observation: **noticing is not the same as knowing**. To compare events, track them over time, or make decisions at scale, observations must be made precise and consistent. That requires turning perception into numbers through **measurement**, which defines *how* observations are quantified and made reliable.

---

**Observation tells us that something happened, but it does not tell us how much, how often, or how serious it was.** This is why **measurement** exists. Measurement is the act of assigning numbers to observations so they can be compared, repeated, and trusted over time. Without measurement, every observation remains personal and subjective. With measurement, different people and systems can agree on what was seen, even if they were not present at the moment it happened.

At a simple level, **measurement** means answering questions like *how many*, *how long*, *how fast*, or *how big*. In everyday life, checking your body temperature, counting steps, or measuring cooking ingredients are all acts of measurement. In business, revenue, response time, conversion rate, and error count are measurements. Good measurement requires clear definitions and consistency; if a “minute” or a “sale” means different things to different people, the numbers lose meaning. Measurement does not eliminate uncertainty, but it reduces ambiguity enough to allow comparison and learning.

However, numbers alone do not remember themselves. A measured value that is not recorded disappears as quickly as the moment it describes. To preserve measurements beyond the present and make them usable by systems, they must be stored and structured as **data**—the durable memory of what was measured.

---

**Measurement turns observations into numbers, but those numbers only become useful when they are remembered.** This is why **data** exists. Data is recorded measurement—a durable representation of what was observed at a specific point in time. Without data, every decision would rely only on memory or intuition. With data, past experiences can be stored, shared, revisited, and analyzed long after the original event has passed.

At a simple level, **data** is just saved measurement. A written expense, a logged temperature reading, or a timestamped website click are all data. In business, sales transactions, sensor readings, and customer interactions become data once they are recorded in a system. Data allows us to look beyond individual moments and start noticing patterns across time. However, data does not automatically equal understanding. Large volumes of data can be overwhelming, contradictory, or misleading if taken at face value.

This is the natural limit of data: **not everything recorded is meaningful**. Some data reflects real, repeatable patterns, while much of it is random variation, error, or coincidence. To make sense of data, we must learn to separate what matters from what does not—distinguishing **signal** from **noise**.

---

**Data captures many measurements, but not all of them are meaningful.** Real-world systems are messy, and recorded data always contains randomness, error, and fluctuation. This is why the idea of **signal vs noise** exists. The **signal** is the part of the data that reflects a real, underlying pattern in reality, while **noise** is the random variation that does not repeat reliably. The challenge is that both appear mixed together, and at first glance, they often look the same.

At a simple level, signal is what stays consistent when conditions repeat, and noise is what changes unpredictably. In everyday life, your long-term fitness trend is the signal, while daily weight changes are noise. In business, a steady increase in customer demand is signal, while day-to-day sales spikes caused by chance are noise. Separating the two requires looking at data over time, across samples, and in context. Mistaking noise for signal leads to false confidence, while ignoring signal leads to missed opportunities.

Even when a signal is identified, it does not eliminate uncertainty. Patterns describe the past, not the future, and real systems can always change. This means that every action taken based on data is still a **decision under uncertainty**—a judgment call made with incomplete information and imperfect signals.

---

**Perfect certainty is impossible in a changing world.** Reality evolves, data is incomplete, and signals are never perfectly clean. This is why **decision under uncertainty** exists. A decision is not about knowing the future with confidence, but about choosing a course of action using the best available information, while accepting that outcomes may differ from expectations. Uncertainty is not a failure of data or analysis—it is a fundamental property of reality.

At a simple level, making a decision under uncertainty means acting without guarantees. In everyday life, choosing a career, investing money, or deciding to see a doctor all involve uncertainty. In business, launching a product, adjusting prices, or hiring talent are decisions made with partial information and noisy signals. Good decisions do not require perfect predictions; they require clear goals, an understanding of risks, and a willingness to revise beliefs as new data arrives. Over time, decision quality improves not by eliminating uncertainty, but by managing it thoughtfully.

As decisions accumulate, their outcomes must be remembered, compared, and learned from. This creates the need to organize data so it can reliably support future choices at scale. To do that, raw data must be given structure—identities, relationships, and rules—which takes us into the next section: **From Data to Structure**.
