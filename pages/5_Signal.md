A signal is a pattern in observed events that carries meaning. Events are happening constantly, but most of them pass by without significance on their own. A signal emerges only when multiple events are interpreted together. A single moment rarely tells you much; it is the sequence, the repetition, or the trend that begins to matter.

This is why we separate signal from noise. When irrelevant variation is stripped away, what remains is the part that helps us understand something useful. One late payment is just an event. Repeated late payments form a signal. One click on a website is a momentary action. A pattern of clicks suggests interest. A single spike in a sensor reading may be accidental. A sustained rise points to something changing in the system.

Signals are not naturally occurring objects waiting to be discovered. They are constructed. They depend on context and are shaped by purpose. The same set of events can produce very different signals depending on what question is being asked and what decision is at stake. What looks like risk to a bank may look like opportunity to a marketer. Meaning is not in the events themselves, but in how they are grouped and interpreted.

This is also why signals never exist in isolation. They only exist relative to a decision. A pattern matters only because someone needs to act on it. Without a decision in the background, the idea of a signal loses its relevance, quietly looping back to the very first concept.

In practice, however, signals are rarely clean or obvious, because they are almost always entangled with noise.
