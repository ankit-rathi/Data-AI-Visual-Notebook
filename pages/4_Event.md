### Explanation (first principles):

> An event is something that happens at a specific point in time.

It marks a **change** in the state of the world.

Before the event, one thing was true.
After the event, something is different.

### Key Insight (boxed):

> **Data is often a collection of events.**

---

### Simple, Everyday Examples:

* A customer **places an order**
* A payment **fails**
* A sensor **crosses a threshold**
* A user **logs in**
* A file **is uploaded**

Each of these happened once, at a moment in time.

---

### Important Distinction (very important later):

An event is:

* **What happened**
* **When it happened**

It is **not**:

* why it happened
* what it means
* what will happen next

Those come later.

### Subtle Insight (quiet but powerful):

> Systems don’t understand stories.
> They understand events.

This is why reality gets broken into pieces.
