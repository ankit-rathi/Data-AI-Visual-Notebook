### Explanation (first-principles):

> Uncertainty is the gap between what we know now and what will happen next.

If the future were perfectly predictable, uncertainty would not exist.
And if uncertainty did not exist, decisions would be trivial.

Uncertainty is not a failure of intelligence.
It is a **property of reality**.

### Key Insight (boxed):

> **Uncertainty increases with time.**
> The further into the future you look, the less certain you become.

---

### Simple Intuition (non-technical):

You can be almost certain about:

* what happened **yesterday**
* what is happening **right now**

You cannot be certain about:

* next month’s demand
* next year’s interest rates
* whether a customer will churn
* how a market will react

Yet decisions must still be made.

---

### Important Reframe (this is where you shine):

> Data does not eliminate uncertainty.
> It **reduces** it.

No amount of data can guarantee outcomes.
It can only **shift the odds**.

---

### Practical Examples:

* Weather forecasts improve accuracy, not certainty
* Credit scores estimate risk, not repayment
* Recommendation systems predict preference, not behavior
