### Explanation (first-principles, Feynman style):

> A decision is a choice made when the outcome is not fully known.

If the outcome were guaranteed, no decision would be needed.
If there were no options, no decision would exist.

A decision appears only when:

* there are **multiple possible actions**
* the future result of each action is **uncertain**
* time or consequences force a choice

This is why decisions feel uncomfortable.

### Key Insight (boxed or highlighted):

> **Data and AI exist only to support better decisions.**
> They have no value on their own.

### Simple Examples (grounded, non-technical):

* A business deciding **whether to launch a product**
* A bank deciding **whether to approve a loan**
* A doctor deciding **which treatment to recommend**
* An investor deciding **whether to buy, hold, or sell**

In every case:

* the future is unknown
* the cost of being wrong exists
* waiting forever is not an option
