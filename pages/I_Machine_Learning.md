> From first principles, **features** are the measurable aspects of reality we choose to observe, while **labels** represent the outcomes we want to predict. When features and labels are paired together, they form **training data**, which captures past examples of how reality behaved. A **model** is a structured hypothesis that attempts to map features to labels, and **learning** is the process of adjusting this model so it fits the patterns in the training data. If the model learns these examples too precisely, it may also learn noise, resulting in **overfitting**, where performance is high on known data but poor on new cases. The real objective is **generalization**, the ability to perform well on unseen data from the same underlying process. **Evaluation** measures whether the model generalizes by testing it on data it has not learned from, and **inference** is the final step where the trained and evaluated model is used to make predictions on new, real-world inputs.
