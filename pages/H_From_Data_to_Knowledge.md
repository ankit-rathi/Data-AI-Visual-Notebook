> From first principles, this process starts with **information**—raw observations about what is happening in the world. When we organize and interpret this information, it becomes **insight**, something that helps us understand a situation or make a decision. As we analyze information, we often notice **correlations**, where two things seem to move together, but correlation alone does not tell us why something happens. To get closer to the truth, we look for **causation**, asking whether one thing actually causes another. This leads us to form a **hypothesis**, which is a clear, testable explanation of a possible cause-and-effect relationship. We then test the hypothesis through an **experiment**, where we deliberately observe what happens under controlled conditions. The results flow back into a **feedback loop**, improving our understanding, refining future hypotheses, and steadily turning new information into more accurate and useful insight.

> Information → Insight → Correlation → Causation → Hypothesis → Experiment → Feedback Loop
