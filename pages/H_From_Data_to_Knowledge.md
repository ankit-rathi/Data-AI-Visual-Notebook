> From first principles, the process begins with **information**, which is raw observations about the world. When this information is organized and interpreted, it turns into **insight**—something that helps us understand or decide. While analyzing information, we often detect **correlations**, where things appear related, but correlation alone does not explain why something happens. To move closer to truth, we look for **causation**, identifying whether one factor actually causes another. This leads to forming a **hypothesis**, a testable explanation of the suspected cause-and-effect relationship. The hypothesis is then tested through an **experiment**, where we deliberately observe outcomes under controlled conditions. The results feed into a **feedback loop**, refining our understanding, improving future hypotheses, and continuously transforming new information into more accurate and actionable insight.

> Information → Insight → Correlation → Causation → Hypothesis → Experiment → Feedback Loop
