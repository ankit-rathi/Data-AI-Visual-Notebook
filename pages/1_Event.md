An event is something that happens at a specific point in time. It marks a change in the state of the world. Before the event, one condition was true; after it, something is different. Events are the moments where reality moves from one state to another, even if the change itself feels small or ordinary.

Much of what we call data is simply a record of these moments. Data is often nothing more than a collection of events captured over time. A customer placing an order, a payment failing, a sensor crossing a threshold, a user logging in, or a file being uploaded—each of these happens once, at a particular instant. Together, they form the raw timeline from which systems attempt to understand the world.

An event, by its nature, is limited. It tells us what happened and when it happened. It does not explain why it happened, what it means in a broader context, or what will happen next. Those interpretations are layered on later, often by humans or models trying to make sense of patterns across many events.

This is why complex realities get broken into simple pieces. Systems do not understand narratives, intentions, or stories. They understand discrete events, ordered in time. Reality is fragmented not because it truly is fragmented, but because this is the only way machines can work with it.

When enough events are observed together, some of them begin to stand out from the noise, carrying meaning beyond a single moment—that is when an event starts to become a signal.
