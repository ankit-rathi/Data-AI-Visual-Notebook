# **L. From Complexity to Wisdom**

> From first principles, **complex systems** are made up of many interacting parts where causes and effects are rarely linear or immediate. In such systems, we rely on **incentives** to guide behavior, because people respond to what is rewarded or punished. To manage complexity, we often create metrics and targets—but this is where **Goodhart’s Law** emerges: once a measure becomes a target, it stops being a good measure, because people optimize for the number rather than the underlying intent. This optimization produces **second-order effects**—unintended consequences that appear downstream, often hidden at first, but powerful over time. Since no metric can fully capture reality, **human judgment** becomes essential to interpret context, anticipate side effects, and know when rules or numbers are misleading. When human judgment is informed by experience, humility, and an understanding of trade-offs within complex systems, it matures into **wisdom**—the ability to choose actions that are not just locally optimal, but systemically and ethically sound over the long run.
