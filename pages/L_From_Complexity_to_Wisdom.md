# **L. From Complexity to Wisdom**

> From first principles, **complex systems** are made up of many connected parts, where cause and effect are rarely simple or immediate. In such systems, behavior is often shaped through **incentives**, because people naturally respond to what is rewarded or penalized. To manage this complexity, we create metrics and targets—but this introduces **Goodhart’s Law**: when a measure becomes a target, it stops being a good measure, because people begin optimizing for the number instead of the real goal. This behavior creates **second-order effects**—unintended consequences that appear later and are often invisible at first. Because no metric can fully represent reality, **human judgment** is essential to understand context, anticipate side effects, and recognize when numbers are misleading. When this judgment is guided by experience, humility, and an awareness of trade-offs within complex systems, it becomes **wisdom**—the ability to make decisions that are not just locally efficient, but fair, resilient, and beneficial over the long term.
