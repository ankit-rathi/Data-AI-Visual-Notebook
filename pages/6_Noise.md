Noise is variation that does not carry meaning for the decision you are trying to make. It is not “bad data” in the usual sense. Noise is simply irrelevant or misleading variation—changes that look important but do not actually reflect anything that matters. Every real-world signal contains noise, because the world itself is not clean or orderly.

In fact, disorder is the default state. The world is noisy by nature, and moments of clear structure are the exception. Sales may drop suddenly not because demand has changed, but because of a holiday, a one-time system outage, or a reporting glitch. Website traffic may spike not because interest has increased, but because of a bot, an accidental link share, or a tracking error. These movements are not trends or insights; they are noise masquerading as meaning.

A common mistake is to assume that collecting more data will automatically solve this problem. In reality, noise does not disappear as data grows. It often increases. More data means more measurements, more edge cases, and more randomness to contend with. Without careful thinking, additional data can amplify confusion rather than reduce it.

This is where systems and dashboards quietly mislead. When noise is mistaken for signal, decisions are made with great confidence and poor outcomes. The numbers look precise, the charts look convincing, and the conclusions feel solid—yet they rest on variation that does not actually matter.

To cope with a noisy world, we do not eliminate noise; we try to manage it, and the primary tool we use for that is measurement.
