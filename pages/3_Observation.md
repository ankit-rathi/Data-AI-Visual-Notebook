Observation is simply the act of noticing something in the world. Because the world is vast and messy, we can never observe everything. We are forced to choose what to observe and how to observe it, whether we are aware of that choice or not. This choice quietly shapes everything that follows, and it matters far more than most people realize.

What we call data is often mistaken for reality itself. In truth, data is only observed reality—a thin slice of the world filtered through human decisions, instruments, and constraints. The moment something is observed, it is already reduced, transformed, and framed.

Every act of observation is limited in three fundamental ways. It is partial, because some aspects of reality are always missed. It is biased, because we decide where to look and what to measure. And it is constrained, because tools, cost, time, and technology impose boundaries. Even machines, often assumed to be objective, observe the world through narrow channels defined by sensors, software, and design choices.

This becomes obvious in everyday systems. A website can observe page views, clicks, and time spent, but it cannot directly observe intent, frustration, or hesitation. A bank can observe transactions and account balances, but it cannot see stress, moral intent, or future behavior. What remains unobserved does not disappear—it simply becomes invisible to the system.

This invisibility is dangerous. What you do not observe shapes decisions just as much as what you do. Entire strategies, models, and automated systems fail not because the data they used was wrong, but because critical parts of reality were never observed in the first place.

Once something is observed, however, it does not remain a vague impression—it becomes something that happens at a specific moment, turning observation into an event.
