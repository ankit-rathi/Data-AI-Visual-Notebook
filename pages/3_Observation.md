### Explanation (first principles):

> Observation is the act of noticing something in the world.

We cannot observe everything.
So we choose **what** to observe and **how** to observe it.

This choice matters more than most people realize.

### Key Insight (boxed):

> **Data is not reality.
> Data is observed reality.**

---

### Important Clarification (very powerful):

Observation is always:

* **partial** (some things are missed)
* **biased** (we choose what to look at)
* **constrained** (by tools, cost, time)

Even machines observe through limits.

### Simple Examples:

* A website observes:

  * page views
  * clicks
  * time spent
* But not:
  * user intent
  * frustration
  * hesitation

* A bank observes:

  * transactions
  * balances
* But not:
  * stress
  * moral intent
  * future behavior

### Subtle but Crucial Insight:

> What you don’t observe
> shapes decisions as much as what you do.

This is where many systems fail silently.
